`Fisrt Of All`:\
Docker is not a virtual machine,It is a mechanism to containerize applications and isolate the processes running these applications.
`Notice`:\
Virtual machines are about isolating hardware, Docker is about isolating processes.
`KeyWords`:\
-Dockerfile: a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.\
-Docker Image: created from a so called Dockerfile.\
-Docker Container: from the image the container can be created, we can say the container is a running instances of the image.
